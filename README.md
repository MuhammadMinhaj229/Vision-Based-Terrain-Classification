# Vision-Based Terrain Classification

A deep learning based computer vision project that classifies terrain types from images.  
This system analyses visual patterns of ground surfaces and predicts terrain categories, which can be useful for robotics, autonomous navigation, environmental analysis, and intelligent vision systems.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a neural network model capable of identifying terrain types using image data.  
The model learns visual features such as texture, structure, and spatial patterns to classify terrain categories accurately.

Key objectives:

- Train a neural network for terrain recognition
- Build a simple and modular prediction pipeline
- Maintain a lightweight and structured project workflow

---

## Features

- Image-based terrain classification
- Deep learning model integration
- Simple execution using Python
- Modular project structure
- Easy to extend for real-world applications
